# Getting started

## Installation

You can install the SDK via go modules with your artifactory credentials using the following command:
```shell linenums="0"
export GOPRIVATE=1
git config --global url.\"https://<artifactoryUser>:<artifactoryToken>@github.com\".insteadOf \"https://github.com\"
go install github.com/cyberark/idsec-sdk-golang/cmd/idsec@latest
```

Make sure that the PATH environment variable points to the go binary path, for example:
```shell linenums="0"
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

## CLI Usage

Both the SDK and the CLI support [profiles](howto/working_with_profiles.md), which can be configured as needed and used for consecutive actions.

The CLI has the following basic commands:

- <b>configure</b>: Configure profiles and their authentication methods (see [Configure](commands/configure.md))
- <b>login</b>: Log in using the configured profile authentication methods (see [Login](commands/login.md))
- <b>exec</b>: Execute commands for supported services (see [Exec](commands/exec.md))
- <b>profiles</b>: Manage multiple profiles on the machine (see [Profiles](commands/profiles.md))
- <b>cache</b>: Manage idsec cache on the machine (see [Cache](commands/cache.md))
- <b>upgrade</b>: Upgrade the CLI to the latest version (see [Upgrade](commands/upgrade.md))


### Basic flow

1. Install Idsec SDK and then configure a profile (either silently or interactively):
    ``` shell linenums="0"
    idsec configure --silent --work-with-isp --isp-username myuser
    ```

1. After the profile is configured, log in:
    ``` shell linenums="0"
    idsec login --silent --isp-secret mysecret
    ```

1. Execute actions (such as generating a short-lived SSO password):
    ``` shell linenums="0"
    idsec exec sia sso short-lived-password
    ```
